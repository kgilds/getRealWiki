Girl Scout councils facilitate Get REAL!, a statewide mentoring program for middle school girls. The Get REAL! program aims to help at-risk middle school girls achieve academic success by connecting them to caring mentors in the community. Get REAL! is delivered through 30 small group mentoring sessions. The mentoring sessions provide support, intervention, and connection to other resources to help girls achieve success.

The participating councils include the following organizations:

-   Girl Scouts of Citrus

-   Girl Scout of Gateway Council

-   Girl Scouts of Southeast Florida

-   Girl Scouts of West Central Florida

The Girl Scout councils have partner with around 30 schools and after-school sites to deliver the program. Enrollment targets vary by quarter, with steady increases and a peak in Quarter 3 to serve 900 girls.
