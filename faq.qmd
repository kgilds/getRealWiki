### We need to add a site

Email ðŸ“«:[kevin.gilds\@hey.com](mailto:kevin.gilds@hey.com) and confirm what Girl Scout Council you are from.

> I strive to add sites within a business day.

If the site is still not showing up in the survey form Qualtrics: Email me again, and I will determine if I can reproduce the error.

> If it is still an issue you may need to work with your IT to clear your web cache.

### Data Entry

Data is pulled from Qualtrics every weekend usually Saturday.

Results can be found at this [Site](https://kgilds.github.io/getrealwiki/data-entry-report.html "Data Entry Report")
